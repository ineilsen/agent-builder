# To use this search tool, you must
#
# 1. Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE)
#   * Go to  https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
#   * Click "Add" → Choose sites or use "*" to search the whole web (then enable that in settings).
#   * Note your Search Engine ID (cx).
# 2. Get Google API key
#  * Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
#  * Enable the Custom Search API.
#  * Create an API key under APIs & Services > Credentials.
#
# Use the CSE ID in step 1 to set GOOGLE_SEARCH_CSE_ID environment variable.
# Use the API key in step 2 to set GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY environment variable.
#
# You can optionally set a custom search URL and a custom timeout via the GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL and GOOGLE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT environment variables.
# Otherwise, the default values of "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1" and "30" are used, respectively

        # Some disqualifications from being a front man:
        #   1) Cannot use a CodedTool "class" definition
        #   2) Cannot use a Tool "toolbox" definition

        # call each other is defined within their own specs.
        # This could be a graph, potentially even with cycles.
